# Menu System
This module provides a somewhat improved version of the standard menu and breadcrumb blocks. 
The module was built for pre-stable Drupal 8 due to lack of other options, and therefore does not aim for anything special.

## Accessibility
The drop-down menu has some accessibility support.

- Menu elements are described using ARIA roles.
- The drop-downs can be navigated using regular Tab key but also with arrow keys (up / down).
- Drop-down menus can be closed with the Esc key.
